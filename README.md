# coffeelog

CoffeeLog is a multi tier web application where people can create an account
with their Google accounts, post pictures and other details of their coffee
experiences.

It is intended to be a demo application which is written to demonstrate and
test new DevOps technologies and features of Google Cloud Platform. **You can
deploy this application yourself and play with it.**

It uses:

- Go programming language
- gRPC
- Google Cloud Datastore
- Google Cloud Storage
- Kubernetes on Google Container Engine
- Stackdriver Logging
- Stackdriver Trace

## Setup

The following steps will walk you through on how to prepare requirements, deploy
and run this application:

1. [Requirements](docs/requirements.md)
1. [Set up service credentials](docs/set-up-service-credentials.md)
1. [Set up storage](docs/set-up-storage.md)
1. [Set up a Kubernetes cluster](docs/set-up-storage.md)
1. [Set up continuous image build](docs/set-up-image-build.md)
1. [Set up continuous deployment](docs/set-up-continuous-build.md)
1. [Try out the application!](docs/try-out.md)
1. Lock secrets down to services

Also if you're interested in developing this application yourself:

1. [Running services outside containers](#)
1. [Running locally on Minikube](#)

## Running locally without containers

For quick dev-test cycle, you might want to just run it directly on your dev
machine.

```sh
# make sure GOPATH is set and this repo is cloned to
# src/github.com/ahmetb/coffeelog. cd in to this directory.

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path-to-service-account-file>

# Start user service
go run ./userdirectory/*.go --addr=:8001 --google-project-id=<PROJECT> 

# Start coffee/activity service
go run ./coffeedirectory/*.go --addr=:8002 \
     --user-directory-addr=:8001 \
     --google-project-id=<PROJECT>

# Start web frontend
cd web # we need ./static directory to be present
go run *.go --addr=:8000 --user-directory-addr=:8001 \
    --coffee-directory-addr=:8002 \
    --google-oauth2-config=<path-to-file> \
    --google-project-id=<PROJECT>
```

## Running locally on Minikube

    minikube start

Build the docker image on minikube node:

    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    make

Deploy:

    kubectl apply -f misc/kube/

(Do not forget to change the gcr.io image name in deployment.yml above.)

Find out minikube IP from `minikube ip` and application port from `kubectl get
svc`. web-local service is configured to run on :32000. Head to http://ip:32000
to visit the application.

If you want to login to the app, create fake domain name in /etc/hosts, like
coffee.io and map the `minikube ip` to this hostname and update your OAuth2
configuration on Google API Manager to `http://coffee.io:32000/oauth2callback`.
