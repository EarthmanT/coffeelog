# coffeelog

Coffeelog is a multi-tier web application where coffee enthusiasts can log in
with their Google accounts and share their coffee experiences with other people.

This is intended to be a sample cloud-native application to showcase the best
practices in application deployment, products of [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
and test new features.

Coffeelog is written in [Go](https://golang.org), uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io)
for communication between microservices. It runs on [Google
Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and uses Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage,
[Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/), [Cloud
Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/), [Stackdriver
Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/) and [Stackdriver
Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/).
